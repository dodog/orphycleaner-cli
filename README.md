## Overview

This script scans your home directory for configuration folders that may be "orphaned" — meaning they belong to applications that are no longer installed or in use. It helps you identify and clean up these leftover folders to keep your system tidy.

## Features

- Scans common config locations: `~/.config`, `~/.local/share`, and other hidden folders under your home.
- Matches folders against installed packages (`pacman`), Flatpak apps, `.desktop` applications, AppImages, and executables in your PATH.
- Categorizes folders as Installed, Maybe Installed, or Orphaned.
- Shows a summary count of folders in each category.
- Provides an interactive cleanup interface for orphaned folders with options to Keep, Delete, Skip, or Quit.
- Includes default ignored folders like cache, trash, and other system-related directories.
- Customizable alias mappings for special folder names.

## Usage
1. Download the script to your home directory
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x orphycleaner.sh
   ```
3. Run it from your home directory:
   ```bash
   ./orphycleaner.sh
   ```
    And follow on-screen prompts to review and clean orphaned config folders safely.

> [!WARNING]
> This script cannot guarantee that orphaned folders are truly unused. Please backup and verify before deleting to avoid losing important data.

## Customization
Update the ignored_folders array in the script to exclude additional folders.

Add folder-to-app name aliases in the alias_map section.

## Requirements
[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) or [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with pacman (or adapt package check for your distro).

Optional: Flatpak and AppImage support if you use those package formats.
